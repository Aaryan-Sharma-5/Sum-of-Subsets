# Sum-of-Subsets

# 🥗 Calorie-Based Meal Planner

An interactive web application that simulates the **Sum of Subsets** algorithm through a real-world example: planning a meal within a calorie limit.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To find **all valid combinations** of food items that sum up to a **user-defined calorie goal**, demonstrating the core logic of **backtracking** used in the **Sum of Subsets** problem.

---

## 🖥️ Live Features

✅ Fully interactive and responsive web interface  
✅ Customizable food item list (name, emoji, calories)  
✅ Editable target calorie value  
✅ Step-by-step execution with navigation buttons  
✅ Real-time progress bar  
✅ Visual highlight of the current subset being explored  
✅ Final result summary including:
- Total recursive calls
- Valid subsets found
- Pruned paths

## 🧠 Algorithm Explained

This simulation uses a **backtracking** approach to explore all possible subsets of a given set of food items.  
It highlights:

- 🔍 **Exploring**: Current subset under consideration  
- ✅ **Valid**: Subset that exactly matches the target  
- ❌ **Pruned**: Subset where the sum exceeds the target  

It mirrors how the **Sum of Subsets** algorithm works in computer science problems like:
- Subset sum problem
- Decision trees
- Combinatorial optimization

## 🧪 Sample Use Case

1. Add food items like:
   - 🥪 Sandwich (250 kcal)  
   - 🍎 Apple (100 kcal)  
   - 🥗 Salad (150 kcal)

2. Set target calories: `500 kcal`

3. Choose between:
   - ▶️ Run Full Algorithm
   - 👣 Step-by-Step mode

4. View all valid meal combinations and watch how the algorithm explores them.
